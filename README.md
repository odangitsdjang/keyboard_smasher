Personally motivated by:
  - Tap Tap that used to be popular a few (research) years back on iOS x iPhone 4
  - DDR
  - Osu
And then after research:
  - http://www.flashflashrevolution.com/FFR_the_Game.php
    - Had no idea such a game existed and was so popular

Idea:

  - Node JS backend
  - Upload song and make a map
  - Have a game with a song where you get three keys (QWE)
