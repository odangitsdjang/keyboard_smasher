# [Keyboard Smasher](http://www.davidjang.space)
A beatmap game implemented purely with HTML/CSS/JavaScript. The middle portion of the screen represents a HTML canvas element that will refresh at a rate that will  generally match your monitor's refresh rate. The timing was matched with a standard user in mind (60Hz), sorry 144 Hz users :(.

## How to play
The basic goal of the game is to not fail the song and to achieve the highest score possible. A user will fail if his/her health bar becomes fully red after not hitting a note on time. A note must be hit with Q W or E when the game beat note approaches the bottom portion of the screen.

## Features
This game features three difficulties: easy, medium and hard. The instructions are on the side of the game as seen:
